# Semaphore Simulation
Simulating semaphore algorithm by running threads in critical section represented as devices want to use a network that has limited number of connections

## Run
Input from console: <br />
1. Number of connections to the router (connect to the network)
2. Number of devices that want to use the network.
3. Finally devices' name and type.

## GUI
Visualizing the connections with router by images:
* Connected devises are shown with their images and an orange border around them.
* Waiting devises are shown with their images without any borders.
* When a device finished its work, its image will be disappeard.
